# DevCommunity

A decentralized platform built by developers, for developers. We're creating a space where blockchain enthusiasts, Web3 builders, and tech innovators can connect, collaborate, and grow together.

DevCommunity is a vibrant, inclusive community where developers can share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and advance the future of decentralized technology. We believe in the power of open-source collaboration and the transformative potential of blockchain technology.

We build a decentralized social platform featuring technical articles, tutorials, project showcases, and a reputation system that recognizes quality contributions. Our platform integrates Cardano wallet authentication and blockchain features, built with modern technologies including React, TypeScript, Node.js, AdonisJS, and PostgreSQL.

We're committed to transparency, collaboration, and open access to knowledge. Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience level, and we value thoughtful contributions over spam.
